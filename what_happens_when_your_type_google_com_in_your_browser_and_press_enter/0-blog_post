What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com in Your Browser and Press Enter

When you type https://www.google.com in your browser and hit Enter, a complex series of steps happen behind the scenes, involving multiple layers of the web stack and networking protocols. Let’s break down each part.

1. DNS Request

Your browser first needs to translate www.google.com into an IP address.

- The browser checks its cache, then the operating system’s cache, and finally queries a DNS server.
- DNS servers respond with the IP address of the web server hosting Google.
- This allows your computer to know where on the internet to send the request.

2. TCP/IP Connection

Once your machine knows the server’s IP, it establishes a connection using the TCP/IP protocol:

* TCP ensures reliable, ordered delivery of packets.
* Your computer initiates a TCP handshake with the server (SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK).
* Each packet travels through routers and switches over the internet until it reaches the server.

3. Firewall

During this communication, firewalls on your local machine, your network, or the server may inspect packets.

- They filter traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
- Only allowed traffic reaches the Google servers, protecting both client and server from unauthorized access.

4. HTTPS / SSL

Since the URL starts with https://, your browser and the server perform an SSL/TLS handshake:

- The server presents its SSL certificate to prove its identity.
- The browser verifies the certificate with a trusted certificate authority (CA).
- Both sides negotiate a session key for encrypted communication.
- From now on, all data exchanged is encrypted, protecting privacy and integrity.

5. Load Balancer

Google’s infrastructure uses load balancers to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers:

- The load balancer selects an appropriate backend server using algorithms like round-robin, least connections, or geolocation.
- This ensures traffic is efficiently handled, prevents single servers from overloading, and improves reliability.

6. Web Server

The chosen server runs a web server (like Nginx or Google’s custom web server):

- It handles HTTP requests, serves static content (HTML, CSS, JS), and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
- The web server manages sessions, headers, caching, and redirects.

7. Application Server

For dynamic requests (like search queries), the web server forwards the request to an application server:

- The application server runs the logic needed to process the query.
- It may interact with various services, APIs, or internal systems.
- In Google’s case, the application server interprets your search and prepares results.

8. Database

If the request requires stored data, the application server queries a database:

- The database stores persistent information (indexes, user data, configurations).
- It responds with the requested data, which the application server processes and formats for the client.

9. Response Back to Browser

After the application server prepares the response:

- The web server sends the response back through the load balancer.
- Data travels over TCP/IP back to your computer.
- The browser decrypts the data (HTTPS) and renders the page using the DOM and CSS rules.
- Finally, you see the Google homepage or search results in your browser.

Conclusion:
Typing a URL seems simple, but the process involves DNS resolution, TCP/IP networking, firewalls, SSL encryption, load balancing, web servers, application servers, and databases. Understanding these steps demonstrates knowledge of how the web stack works end-to-end, which is essential for developers, SREs, and network engineers.
